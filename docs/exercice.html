<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Today you are going to learn how to handle processes in C. This will also teach you the basics of inter-process communication using redirections.</p>
<p>Here are the provided files for this part: <a href="subject.tar">Skeleton</a></p>
<p>Use the following command to extract the files :</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>asm$ tar -xvf &lt;filename&gt;.tar.gz</code></pre>
<h1 id="tonight-the-nightmare-is-back">Tonight, the nightmare is back</h1>
<p>Remember yesterdays’ practical ? Today, will be handling it once more… Now that you’ve acquired some new low-level skills, we will be using them to defeat the game.</p>
<p>You probably haven’t succeeded in finishing the game by hand, that’s why you’re going to have to let someone else that is way faster than you do it: your computer.</p>
<p>Your goal today is to write a program that will complete the signal game.</p>
<p>Your program will: 1. Launch the binary file given by argument 2. Get the <code>stdout</code> output of the program through a pipe 3. Read through the created pipe the signal currently required by the game 4. Send the required signal to the process</p>
<p>Here is the expected behavior of the program:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>asm$ ./cheater ./&lt;game_binary&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can get the binary from <a href="https://asm-2024.github.io/jour3/signals.html#sending-signals">yesterdays’ practical</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cheater.h">cheater.h</h2>
<p>We would strongly recommend you to have a look at <code>cheater.h</code> to see all the included headers and the defined macros.</p>
<p>You will have access through this header to: - signals: global variable of type <code>char **</code> which is an array of all the signal strings in the correct order. - NB_SIGNALS: macro that will enable you to access the number of elements inside the <code>signals</code> array. - BUFF_SIZE: macro that you should use for your buffer size.</p>
<h2 id="cheater.c">cheater.c</h2>
<p>In this file, we have given you a simple structure containing different functions to complete. You’ll have to complete them by following the described steps.</p>
<h3 id="string_to_signal">string_to_signal</h3>
<p>This function will be used in the <code>main</code> function. The goal is to retrieve the number of the signal based on its textual representation.</p>
<p>Hint : do not forget that in C, arrays are zero-based!</p>
<h3 id="read_until">read_until</h3>
<p>This function is also used in the <code>main</code> function. Its purpose is to read from the file descriptor <code>fd</code> until the character <code>delim</code> is found. You may assume that in this exercise the buffer <code>buf</code> of size <code>buf_size</code> is large enough. Do not forget to append a null byte after the last character read otherwise the sequence won’t be considered as a valid string.</p>
<h3 id="execute">execute</h3>
<p>Here comes the heavy lifting. In this function, you’ll directly use what you’ve learned this morning.</p>
<p>The goal of this function is to execute the <code>executable</code> binary in a child process after doing the necessary redirections.</p>
<p>For this function you’ll need to have a look at <code>execvp(3)</code> which will allow you to execute the <code>executable</code> along with <code>fork(2)</code>.</p>
<p>But before you do so, you will have to do the appropriate redirections using <code>dup2(2)</code> and <code>pipe(2)</code>. Do not forget to close the appropriate ends of the pipe created after having “duped” the standard output.</p>
<h1 id="extra-exercise">Extra exercise</h1>
<p>For anyone willing to do extra exercises regarding low-level process handling and redirection, we suggest you take a look at the practical given during the past years <a href="https://prepa.pages.epita.fr/asm/strasbourg-c-unix-seminar/practicals/D3/practical3.html">right here</a></p>
<h1 id="correction">Correction</h1>
<p>A correction will be given this weekend. It will be on the Github repository and the link will be given here. This will <strong>not</strong> be the <strong>only</strong> nor <strong>the best</strong> solution to the problem but do take the time to read it as it uses advanced concepts!</p>
